> Utilizing philosophical history, reality and future.

Historic philosophy, dating back to ancient times, laid the foundation for much of the thought we engage with today. Ancient Greek philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle focused on questions of ethics, politics, metaphysics, and knowledge. Their work emphasized reasoning, virtue, and the pursuit of truth, creating frameworks that have influenced Western thought for centuries. In Eastern philosophy, thinkers like Confucius and Laozi explored concepts of morality, harmony, and the nature of reality, impacting Eastern cultural and spiritual traditions. Historic philosophy often revolved around understanding the human condition, our place in the world, and the best way to live.

In the modern era, philosophy evolved to address new social, scientific, and existential challenges. The Enlightenment period, for example, saw thinkers like Kant, Descartes, and Rousseau questioning authority, tradition, and the nature of knowledge itself. Their focus shifted more towards individualism, rationality, and human rights, which paralleled revolutions in science and politics. Existentialism emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries, with philosophers like Nietzsche, Sartre, and Kierkegaard grappling with themes of meaning, freedom, and the anxiety of existence in a world where traditional structures of meaning seemed to collapse. This modern period broadened philosophical inquiry, delving deeper into the human experience and subjectivity.

Today, modern philosophy continues to evolve in response to contemporary issues such as technology, environmental concerns, and social justice. Postmodern thinkers like Foucault and Derrida questioned the idea of absolute truths, emphasizing that knowledge and power are often intertwined and subjective. Meanwhile, the rise of applied philosophy has brought philosophical thought into discussions on artificial intelligence, bioethics, and political theory, demonstrating the continued relevance of philosophy in solving real-world problems. This blend of historic insights with modern dilemmas shows the dynamic nature of philosophy, adapting to the changing needs of society while remaining rooted in the age-old pursuit of wisdom.

### Needs and Wants

![Balance](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa2ae5e7-0a1f-4dfa-a47e-0ec43a6df00b)

Balancing wants and needs requires self-awareness and discipline. Needs are the essential things required for survival and well-being, such as food, shelter, healthcare, and safety. Wants, on the other hand, are things that enhance comfort, pleasure, or status but are not crucial for survival. To find balance, it’s important to clearly define and distinguish between the two. Start by evaluating what is truly necessary to maintain a stable and healthy life. Once you’ve met these needs, you can consider indulging in wants—but with moderation.

Creating a budget or a plan can help in balancing the two. Prioritize your needs first, ensuring that resources like time, energy, and money are directed toward those essentials. After that, allocate a portion of your remaining resources to your wants. This approach ensures that your wants don't overshadow your needs, and you don’t end up compromising your well-being in pursuit of desires.

It’s also helpful to practice delayed gratification. Instead of immediately giving in to a want, pause and assess whether it’s something you truly desire or if it’s a temporary impulse. Waiting can often provide clarity on whether the want is worth pursuing. Moreover, by practicing mindfulness, you can better understand the emotions and motivations driving your wants, allowing for a more thoughtful and intentional approach.

Finally, it’s important to acknowledge that wants are not inherently bad. They add richness and enjoyment to life. The goal is not to eliminate wants but to enjoy them in a balanced way, ensuring that they don’t lead to overspending, unhealthy habits, or stress. By finding this equilibrium, you can enjoy a fulfilling life while maintaining a strong foundation built on your needs.
